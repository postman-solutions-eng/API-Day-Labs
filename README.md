# API-Day-Labs

The workshop will feature a Sandbox Instance equipped with Sample Workspaces, including a meticulously curated "Golden Workspace," and access to a Private API Network. Prior to the event, participants will be seamlessly added to the instance, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience from the outset.

Structured as a combination of presentation, hands-on lab sessions, the event promises to be both informative and interactive. Attendees will delve into practical exercises, gaining practical insights into leveraging Postman Free and exploring the advanced functionalities of Postman Enterprise.

Following the event, participants will enjoy continued access to the Sandbox Instance for an extended duration, enabling them to further explore the platform's capabilities at their own pace. Additionally, detailed instructions for requesting access to the enterprise instance, along with a comprehensive Starter Guide, will be provided, empowering users to seamlessly transition to Postman Enterprise.

## Labs Scenario
Imagine you're a pivotal member of the development team tasked with creating a cutting-edge recommendation service, where the "Shared Services'' team has meticulously documented their "Subscription Service" API within Postman.

In this dynamic environment, your primary goal is to validate the key user story of your burgeoning service. This entails a multi-faceted approach, beginning with a customer subscribing to a specific SKU and actively engaging with your service.
To ensure the seamless functionality of your Recommendation Service, you aim to rigorously assess its behavior within a controlled development environment. Your insights and feedback will be crucial in refining the existing Subscription Service team's environment to align with evolving project requirements.

To expedite this process, you'll prototype the API within Postman, allowing for swift iteration and validation prior to full-scale implementation. Additionally, you'll diligently craft unit tests and integration tests to fortify the reliability and robustness of your service.

In essence, these exercises encapsulate a holistic approach to software development, seamlessly integrating prototyping, testing, and collaboration to drive innovation and excellence in product delivery.

Let’s review your user story
**<u>As an</u> AI Service Subscriber
<u>I want to</u> see new AI features such as better Descriptions and Sentiment Analysis when I get Product Recommendations
<u>So that</u> I can better cross sell from my existing product catalog**

With the understanding in place about what we are trying to accomplish, let’s begin the first Lab.
